# SALARY


## How is Salary Calculated

If your pay is based on the number of hours you work, salaries are calculated by aggregating the total number of days in a month and your total hours worked. Hence, each month has a different hourly rate. If you work more than 40 hours a week, we cap it at that amount or 8 hours each day (Monday through Friday). For those extra hours, you will NOT be compensated. If this is the case, we strongly advise you to take some time off and do something else. We want you to balance your professional and personal lives. That's significant. Spend the time on your personal projects if you still wish to work.

We advise you to work no more than eight hours every day. We've put a hard cap at eight hours, so if you're still working on the task, you need to finish it. Anything beyond those eight hours won't be considered.

Note: Never add manual time or clock in when idle on Hubstaff. Every Monday, we conduct thorough compliance checks and audits. If we discover inactivy in your account, you won't be paid for it, and you'll also be charged for the number of hours you waste each week. As an example, if you have 5 hours of downtime, your compensation will be reduced by 5 hours of regular work and you won't get paid for those 5 hours. This matters to us much. If your goal is to accumulate time. We don't't want you on our team.
