# Communication Policy


## Introduction

This policy provides us with effective communication rules and guidelines that will help us operate effectively as a company. 

## TL;DR

As a remote team, it is essential to establish daily check-in calls and chat with the team or your manager. All company discussion should be done via the Discord platform and necessary documents shared via emails for reference purpose.
Communicate expectations around response times to emails and chats. Make sure to consider time zones and workload.
