# Values

Be the Cuesoft ACE. 


## Accountability: 
 - There is no secrecy at Cuesoft, there is nothing to hide. We encourage transparency and accountability amongst our employees. Be truthful in all affairs with customers, and other stakeholders in the company.
 - We respect you, do not let us down. Do not engage in activities that will damage the reputation of the company, and/or yourself in any way possible. 
 - We encourage our employees to be responsible citizens of their various countries and be good ambassadors of Cuesoft to the general public. 
 

## Collaboration:
 - Being a remote company, the importance of effective communication cannot be overemphasised. Hence, we encourage effective communication amongst our employees.
 - Swift and timely responses to emails, messages and calls are mandatory and offenders will be sanctioned appropriately. 
 - We don't encourage bullies, trolls and the likes on and off the workplace. We believe in being kind, reasonable, and compassionate. Employees are encouraged to own these qualities at all times and in all circumstances.

## Excellence: 
- We perceive work done as value over time. A [strong work ethic](/general/work-ethic/README.md) and culture is our drive at Cuesoft, and we want this instilled in our employees because its importance cannot be overstated. 
- Things like failing to show up for standup without informing HR or failing to complete a task before the deadline will not be tolerated. 
- Work should be easy, work should be simple. We don't like complexity, hence breaking down tasks is highly encouraged. When working on a project, look for the easiest solution. Our products should be easy to build and use respectively. If any form of difficulty is involved, then the workflow process needs to be redrafted.
- Make it simple! Work smart, hard. 
- We believe that the customer is king. We wouldn't be here if they didn't help keep the business running. That is the value we place on our customers. And at such, all staff should make great effort to treat our customers most appropriately. 


### All these qualities are what we seek in our employees, wear them like your sleeve.


#### Now that you are here, be the supreme *CUESOFT ACE*
