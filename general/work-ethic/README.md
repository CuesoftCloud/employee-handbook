# Work Ethic

## TL;DR

Work is similar to worship. You feed your family and pay your bills with it. Always be true to your words and commitments. Minor infractions, such as failing to show up for standup without alerting your team lead/manager, or failing to report to a client on time without informing him beforehand, will not be tolerated.

## Introduction

A lot of millennials these days do not have a strong work ethic, [they don't have patience, they rarely work on something they promised and rarely commit to a larger goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEsUudZvntE) - all they want is to get by today, and see what comes up tomorrow. “Work Ethic” was never taught to them. Not by parents, not by university. No one told you how important this is unless you actually tip over, fall down and learn a lesson, and sometimes by then - it’s too late.

Work is literally almost all there is. It literally puts food on the table for your family, and pays the bills. It keeps all of us afloat.  Few things like, not showing up on standup without letting your manager  know, or not reporting to a client at a scheduled time without letting him know in advance will *not* be tolerated.

Its harmful long term. It destroys the culture we have in the company and is a strong head wind against building a long lasting company. From this point on, If you do not have a strong work ethic, we don't want to be working with you if you do not have a strong work ethic. We will register a [violation](/people-operations/violation/README.md) against you if you do it again, we’ll boot you off immediately.
